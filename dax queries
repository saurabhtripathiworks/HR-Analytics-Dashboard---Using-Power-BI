Process
Imported data from Excel and transformed it from a wide table view to a tall table view, putting all dates into one column.
Created a measure table to include various measures for detailed analysis.

Measures Defined
Presence %:
Presence % = DIVIDE([Present Days], [Total Working Days], 0)

Present Days:
Present Days =
VAR presentdays = CALCULATE(COUNT('Final Data'[Value]), 'Final Data'[Value] = "P")
RETURN presentdays + [WFH Count]

SL % (Sick Leave %):
SL % = DIVIDE([SL Count], [Total Working Days], 0)

SL Count (Sick Leave Count):
SL Count = SUM('Final Data'[SL Count])

Total Working Days:
Total Working Days =
VAR totaldays = COUNT('Final Data'[Value])
VAR nonworkdays = CALCULATE(COUNT('Final Data'[Value]), 'Final Data'[Value] IN {"WO", "HO"})
RETURN totaldays - nonworkdays

WFH % (Work From Home %):
WFH % = DIVIDE([WFH Count], [Present Days], 0)

WFH Count (Work From Home Count):
WFH Count = SUM('Final Data'[WFH Count])

Additional Tables Created
Created a month table like "Apr 22".
Added tables for WFH count, SL count, and day of the week ("MON").
